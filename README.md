# Frame
A personal projects website based on [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) for high school students to show their works.   
v1.0.0 was finished in 10 hrs.

## Introduction
Frame was built initially for high school students to present their works in an elegant and simple way.
Frame's goal is to let students who don't have programming experience can also be able to set up their own websites for displaying purpose. Though at current state, v1.0.0, students still need some knowledge related to web programming, especially nodejs, json, and pug, this should be achieved in next version, v2.0.0.
Frame utilizes [MongDB](https://mongodb.com) as its database. This allows users to dynamically load their descriptions about their projects and websites directly from databases rather than using local HTML files.  
For handling requests, Frame use [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [pug](https://pugjs.org).  
## Preparation
